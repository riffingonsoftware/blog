Yet another failure. Actually, let me own that. I failed again.

I recently applied to a masters program, and I was rejected. I'm not even a little surprised. I'm a little disappointed, but I'm not surprised. Why?

1. My undergrad GPA is bad (2.7). (I'd say "was," but I guess it'll always be with me.)
2. I used to be good at math...
  1. Turns out, at least for me, math is definitely a use it or lose it kind of skill. I'm confident I could get it back, but...
  2. I rushed into the GRE and scored poorly on the math section (157 or 52nd percentile).

So, why am I sharing all of that?

I don't want your pity or condolences. I'm good.

Really, I just wanted to share some failure. Going on social media it's easy to think everyone else is winning all the time. We're not. Think you're having a bad day? You're not alone. There are plenty of people out there having a much worse day. After all, you have time to read this stupid blog post!
