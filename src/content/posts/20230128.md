## Adding Comments

I was a bit resistant to the idea of adding comments to this blog. I could list off reasons, but I'm not sure any of them would be the exact reason. I'm not sure why I was resistant. Regardless, 2 (of the probably 3 people in the whole world) reading this blog would occasionally give me a hard time about their absence. Since there's nobody around, I figured there wasn't much harm in me adding them.

Keeping with trying to do things around here for free, I opted to go with [giscus](https://giscus.app/). (I also considered [utterances](https://utteranc.es/), opting for giscus simply because it uses [GitHub Discussions](https://docs.github.com/en/discussions) rather than [GitHub Issues](https://docs.github.com/en/issues), and that felt right.)

So, this was the first dynamic content I wanted to add. As such, I needed to pick how I wanted to do that. Since I'd been wanting to play with [SolidJS](https://www.solidjs.com/), it was a good time to go ahead and add it. This was definitely *not* a particularly good sampling of its capabilities, but it was a good time to start.

My usual disclaimer about any problems with how I did it reflecting on me and not the tools applies. I'm almost certain it could have been done better, but I gotta start somewhere.

I guess we'll see if anyone ever uses it. Along those lines... I wonder if I should figure out how to get some privacy-respecting analytics. Hmm... If anyone has ideas for that, well... drop a comment below. ðŸ˜‰
