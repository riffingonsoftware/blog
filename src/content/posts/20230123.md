## Just a couple of quick recommendations for you.

* I've mentioned [Changelog](https://changelog.com/) before. Go check out their [podcasts](https://changelog.com/podcasts) and maybe subscribe to [Changelog Weekly](https://changelog.com/weekly). It brought the following to my attention...
* [This excellent post](https://www.simplethread.com/20-things-ive-learned-in-my-20-years-as-a-software-engineer/) by [Justin Etheredge](https://www.simplethread.com/author/jetheredge/).
  * The only thing I don't think I agree with in that post is, "The only way someone can be a 10x programmer is if you compare them to 0.1x programmers." I'm not sure I buy into the 10x engineer, but I feel there are definitely some folks a cut above.
