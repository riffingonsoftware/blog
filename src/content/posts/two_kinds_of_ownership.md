[The story of the two wolves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_Wolves) has been attributed to many different sources. I'll do a poor job of summarizing it by simply saying the intent is to impress upon the listener the idea one can be good or bad based on which nature one embraces, or feeds. In a similar vein, so too goes ownership. One path leads to the dark side...

## The Dark Side

The dark side of ownership is when someone becomes the only path to action. It might feel as if they are the only one who can get anything done. It might feel like they're a hero. It may feel like they're the only path to success. Worse, they start to believe it. The don't want anyone else to touch the code, their code.
