Goodbye, Netlify. Thanks for all the fish.

A while back, I changed registrars from [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/) to [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/registrar/) due to [some possibly shady activity](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35344122). Anecdotally, I had searched for a domain on Namecheap, not bought, and came back later to find it held by a reseller. I did absolutely no due diligence whatsoever. It probably wasn't Namecheap and just completely happenstance, but I had low switching costs.

The site itself was hosted on Netlify. Well... I only started using Cloudflare CDN... Yeah, I ran in to some (skill) issues, like [this person](https://answers.netlify.com/t/error-522-cloudflare/5909). I opted to use Cloudflare's CDN... Well, last week, I got notice Netlify was having problems renewing my certificate. I *assumed* this had to do with my CDN choice. Well, I just opted to move the site over to [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/).

It's amazing there are so many free options. Cool times.

Wholly unrelated, I have noticed an issue crept in somewhere over the last few months. The comments at the bottom of posts are supposed to get loaded in when the connection is idle. (I've tried other settings, like visible.) Unfortunately, this seems to work the first time you visit the first post you visit. Subsequent posts require a page reload in order to render the comments. I *suspect*, but have not proven, there was an incompatibility that crept in with an update to Astro and/or [Solid](https://www.solidjs.com/). I may try switching out Solid for [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/), or maybe I'll just replace the whole site with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).
