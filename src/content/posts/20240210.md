So, for anyone following along at home, I mentioned I was having problems with the comments at the bottom of the post pages. Basically, the comments would get loaded the first time you visited a post, but comments wouldn't load for any other posts you visited or if you returned to the original post. Refreshing the page fixed it.

I did a little troubleshooting. I'm using [Giscus](https://giscus.app/) for the comments. Turns out, the script to call it was only being called the one time. Well, I was using [Solid](https://www.solidjs.com/) for that Astro island. I don't know it. I don't really know TypeScript. I'm pretty sure this used to work, but maybe I'm wrong. Maybe it never really worked. I'd been using Solid's [onMount](https://www.solidjs.com/tutorial/lifecycles_onmount) in conjunction with Astro's [client:visible](https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/directives-reference/#clientvisible) directive to try to be slick, but that was overkill. I've gotten rid of onMount and migrated to [client:idle](https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/directives-reference/#clientidle). I think that's probably good enough.

So, all of that is to say I don't know what I'm doing when it comes to TypeScript, or Astro, or Solid. It might be time for me to go write a full project in TypeScript. I have a project in mind I've tried to start a few times. Originally, it was going to be a [Go](https://go.dev/) backend (I owe a post about why I'm moving away from Rust) with a [React](https://react.dev/) frontend. I then tossed it out and was going to go with Go, [templ](https://templ.guide/), and [HTMX](https://htmx.org/). Now, I've been considering going with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) so I can use TypeScript all the way through. Hmm... More to come. Happy hacking!
