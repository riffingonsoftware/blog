A writer's voice is like a fingerprint. Okay, perhaps that is a bit too strong. Some writers can change voice, some very successfully. That said, I think plenty tend to develop a singular, distinct voice. You'll sometimes hear them talk about taking care with editors potentially removing or running rough shod over their voices.

Writing code is like that. I can sometimes look at code I wrote years ago and say, yep, I wrote that. (In a world with rustfmt, gofmt, gofumpt, and similar, this is less true than in the past, but even so...)

In a world with AI... well... all the code starts to look the same, or at least similar.
