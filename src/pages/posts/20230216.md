Okay, so I finally decided to start playing with [WebAssembly (Wasm)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebAssembly). Late last year, my friend, [Damani Corbin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/damani-corbin-4329089) introduced me to [Liam Randall](https://twitter.com/Hectaman). Liam is CEO of [Cosmonic](https://cosmonic.com/), a primary supporter of [WasmCloud](https://wasmcloud.com/) (I'mma be real, not sure if I'm supposed to point [here](https://wasmcloud.com/) or [here](https://wasmcloud.dev/)). I shared with [him and everyone else](https://twitter.com/ricardooncode/status/1599095843872727043?s=20) how I want to be less an observer this go round, as compared to my lack of involvement in the early days of containers.

So, I figured the best place to start was with play. So, I started with the [Overview](https://wasmcloud.dev/overview/). One of the things I really like about WasmCloud is the emphasis on what's not there. You can see one example [here](https://wasmcloud.dev/app-dev/create-actor/generate/). One of the ideas is to allow developers to focus on the business logic. Okay, let's collect some random thoughts:

* I don't love the use of Makefile, but I get it.
* Docs are pretty good.
* I didn't spend a lot of time troubleshooting, but after a brief attempt I failed to be able to run my unit test inside my IDE (CLion... for now). All good, using command line saw it executed easily enough.
* [The docs for securing](https://wasmcloud.dev/app-dev/secure/) are about the platform. They say you should check the [reference apps](https://wasmcloud.dev/reference/refapps) for details on implementing user security. Unfortunately, it looks like that's [an open issue](https://github.com/wasmCloud/wasmcloud-dev-site/issues/40).

If you wanna look at examples from professionals, you can see example actors from the wasmCloud folks on [GitHub](https://github.com/wasmCloud/examples/tree/main/actor). But hey, I've slept at a Holiday Inn before...

Okay, so let's share what I did, starting with what I wanted to achieve. I wanted to create a simple actor to provide a single HTTP GET endpoint and serve data from a single table in PostgreSQL.

For expediency, I created a database via docker-compose and populated a single table with an init.sql. You can get the whole project on GitHub [here](FIXME). (Side notes: Don't use latest in tags. I don't really care about table names being plural vs singular. I just used TEXT because I'm lazy; don't use TEXT as much as I did. I love Star Trek, but I did not obsessively review the data I threw in the table. Sorry!)

Generating your actor via wash is covered in the [docs](https://wasmcloud.dev/app-dev/), as is [combining capabilities](https://wasmcloud.dev/app-dev/multicap/). So, let's look at some code.

```rust
use wasmbus_rpc::actor::prelude::*;
use wasmcloud_interface_httpserver::{HttpRequest, HttpResponse, HttpServer, HttpServerReceiver};
```
