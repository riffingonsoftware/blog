The winds of change are blowing across the industry and for me. I don't fully know what that change means for me. I don't rightly know what I'm going to do with this space. I do plan to mostly riff on software, but I may direct my interest into other domains from time to time.

> The wind was not the beginning. There are neither beginnings nor endings to the Wheel of Time. But it was a beginning. &mdash; Robert Jordan
