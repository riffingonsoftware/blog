Let me tell you a story about the time I *almost* quit Rust... again and why I can't really recommend everyone go and use it.

I've heard some folks dismiss Rust a systems programming language. Even if it was ever "just" that, I don't think it's just that anymore. Rust can do most things now, and with recent efforts like [Polars](https://www.pola.rs/) it can even threaten some previously unassailable positions. The problem I see is... well... you'll like it the most if you're a systems programming kind of person.



















First, you should really be using TypeScript if you're going to be using the JavaScript ecosystem. Whew, glad I got that out of the way.

I've referenced this quote [previously](./20230120.md) and the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rczu8kc8JZA) before. JavaScript has won. I have to admit it. I don't have to like it, but maybe I should learn to like it.

To be fair, I also preferred [Mercurial](https://www.mercurial-scm.org/) over Git. So, what do I know? Today, I use Git all the time. It's not just okay, it's really good, and I can just choose to not do the parts I dislike (or conform to my team's practices like a good teammate).

So, I can get over myself. I'm comfortable being wrong. I've often been wrong in the past. If you're not often wrong, you're playing it too safe. So, I've been wrong about JavaScript.

I really hoped Rust was the answer. I got over the hump. I am *definitely not* saying I became a competent Rust developer. What I can say was I was making good progress after hitting a bit of a wall. Once I started making that progress, there was a nagging feeling in the back of my head. What was that? Why would I be bothered now I was making progress? Well...

Rust just makes everything feel harder *to me*. Everything took a little more effort than some alternatives I've used in the past. I'm sure if you were a hardcore C or C++ developer, you'd love Rust. It's like a better version of things you're used to (sure not to the same extant for each of those, but I think the point still stands), and it makes you safer by default. But if you're not using one of those (or a language with some similar features), then I think you're going to be in for a good bit more effort.

But, but... the performance!

Listen, you're right. That performance is what got me going down the Rust path in the first place. I came across [this excellent article from Hackaday](https://hackaday.com/2021/11/18/c-is-the-greenest-programming-language/), referencing [this data](https://sites.google.com/view/energy-efficiency-languages/). (There's also some newer data there.) So, Rust is second for Energy & Time only to C, and it's in the second tier for Energy & Time & Memory.

(Yes, yes, benchmarks are a loser's game. Yes, I know you've seen other benchmarks where X beats Y, and there are circumstances where Z is amazing and A is trash.)

This one dataset was enough to get me to seriously consider Rust for all things. It's funny because I can't say the same about C. (Peace! It's easy for me to say why. Here's [an article](https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-70-percent-of-all-security-bugs-are-memory-safety-issues/) referencing a comment by a Microsoft engineer indicating 70 percent of vulnerabilities in Microsoft products addressed through security updates each year were memory safety issues. Rust can help avoid that.)

I should come clean. Earlier I said it was the performance. That's not entirely true. I've written some production code in languages further down the list referenced above. There have been remarkably few instances wherein I (as part of a team) couldn't eek out "enough" performance. So, that's not really enough for me. Simply, I worry about the environment. There is more code running today than ever in history (I think). So, if I can do my part to decrease the cost of running those systems, I feel compelled to try.

So... after all of that, what am I going to do? Well... I'm going to keep struggling my way through learning Rust. It's the best I have for now. I'll continue to watch [Vale](https://vale.dev/) and other new programming languages. Who knows, maybe [Andrej Karpath](https://karpathy.ai/) was right about [English being the way ahead](https://twitter.com/karpathy/status/1617979122625712128).

Wait, I thought you said JavaScript won, and the description of this post is "making pragmatic choices." What gives? Well... truthfully... I think "you" should probably use TypeScript, unless you have a specific, and unimagined, reason to use something else. I can't yet, in good conscience, advise the wholesale adoption of Rust. Heck, maybe I'll write a post some time about why I'd still recommend a lot of enterprises use Java (or Kotlin).
