I first coined the phrase "I wasn't here for the crazy" almost a decade ago.

One of the easiest things to do as an engineer coming into a new team with any legacy whatsoever is to bash the people who were there before you. What kind of idiot would do X? If only they'd known Y, they could have... And so on... Resist the temptation.

Confession time: Once, I was required to essentially implement cron in Python. I objected, I provided technical reasoning as to why it was a bad idea, and in the end I basically recreated cron in Python. I'm absolutely certain my creation was worse than the battle-hardened cron. I don't know if that code survives today, but anyone picking it up after me would likely think me an idiot. Who in their right mind wouldn't just use cron?

Listen, I agree with that engineer coming in behind me, but... seriously... the situation was crazy. I had the best of intent. I didn't want to do what I eventually did. It simply needed to get done.

Fine. To be fair, I am ashamed... a little. I'm much less ashamed now than I was then. Why?

Well, first, I've grown a tiny bit. I mean, let's not get it twisted, I'm still happy to debate the finer points of making technically superior decisions... I just can now accept the tech isn't the most important thing for a business.
