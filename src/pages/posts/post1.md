> The Wheel of Time turns, and Ages come and pass, leaving memories that become legend. Legend fades to myth, and even myth is long forgotten when the Age that gave it birth comes again. In one Age, called the Third Age by some, an Age yet to come, an Age long past, a wind rose... &mdash; Robert Jordan


The winds of change are blowing across the industry and for me.

> The wind was not the beginning. There are neither beginnings nor endings to the Wheel of Time. But it was a beginning. &mdash; Robert Jordan
