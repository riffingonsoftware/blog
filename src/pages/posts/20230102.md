I agonize over choosing tech. That agonizing will definitely be a recurring topic on this blog.

I had originally intended to write a blog using the very good [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) running on [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) like [so](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/framework-guides/deploy-a-hugo-site/). I still believe those are excellent technologies, and I would have been happy to use them. I've used Hugo quite a bit, especially to host internal sites on [GitLab Pages](https://gitlab.com/pages/hugo).

Unfortunately, well, I can never leave well enough alone. One of my very good friends, a software developer, one of my mentors, admonished me for not simply using [WordPress](https://wordpress.com/). According to WordPress, at the time I'm writing this, it still powers 42% of the web. He argues to go with what's easiest and fulfills your needs. **He's probably right.** I would probably get *much* more done if I followed this advice. But yeah, I can't, I just don't have that in me.

So, I went casting about. I had heard an [interview on JS Party](https://changelog.com/jsparty/238) about [Astro](https://astro.build/), but I'd promptly forgotten about it. I'm not a JavaScript dev. I'm not a fan of the language. No shade for those who love it. I simply do not. TypeScript is a little better, but still, it's not my jam.

I am wanting to pick up some [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), so I considered both [Yew](https://yew.rs/) and [Dioxus](https://dioxuslabs.com/). I may revisit these once I know more Rust. I'm also a big fan of [WebAssembly (Wasm)](https://webassembly.org/), but, if I'm understanding correctly, it's not the most performant in the browser at present, so that was also a strike against these. Plus, very subjectively, I wasn't super impressed with the visual appeal of the examples I found with either. I didn't look very hard. Since I'm not the best at making tech visually appealing, I was hoping for a helping hand here.

So, what's a JavaScript non-fan to do? Admit JS/TS are the ways to build for the web right now. So, I went back to that domain. I'd remembered [Kelsey Hightower](https://twitter.com/kelseyhightower) mentioning [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/). So, I started looking at that. I was going to go down that path, but something reminded me of Astro. I legitimately don't remember what it was. I though it was [this episode of JS Party](https://changelog.com/jsparty/256), but after checking the transcript, if it was this episode, it was my tangential thought process that brought it back to mind. Regardless, I started looking at Astro.

Turns out, Astro also had a bunch of [templates for blogs](https://astro.build/themes/blog/). So, I was pretty much sold. To be fair, I originally had the intent of starting with the [tutorial](https://docs.astro.build/en/tutorial/0-introduction/) to roll my own. Then I thought I'd go with the [official(?) template](https://github.com/withastro/astro/tree/main/examples/blog). Then I thought I might use some of the other templates to inspire me to move towards my own. Finally, I gave up and went with the [one](https://github.com/manuelernestog/astro-modern-personal-website) I thought was the best looking. Go check out the rest of [Manuel Ernesto's work](https://github.com/manuelernestog) and support them. Any problems on *this* site are doubtless my fault and not related to the fine work of the original template.

As the "Official Hosting Partner" of Astro, it seemed like a good time for me to try [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). I'm going to go with the free tier. We'll see how long that lasts me or how far I can take it. I suppose if I ever outgrow the free tier on Netlify, I could always try another free option... or start paying. I mean, that's firmly in the realm of good problems to have, right?

Netlify even automatically integrated with [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) to hook me up with a free certificate. Now that is sweet. That's the kind of quality of life feature that drives adoption of a platform. I haven't played with a lot of Netlify's direct competitors, so I'm not sure if this is a common feature, but, regardless, it's awesome.

# Thank you!

To all the tech and people behind the tech I've used to create this website: THANK YOU! I'm sure I'll use other tech as the site evolves, and I'll try to shout those out as I go, but thanks in advance to those as well.
